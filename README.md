Star Search

You have been contracted by the producers of the highly-rated Star Search game show to write a program that lets fans play a home version of the game. Here's how one round of the game works: The computer picks a secret word of four to six letters and tells the player how many letters are in the word. The player tries to determine the secret word by presenting the computer with a series of probe words. Each probe word is a four to six letter word. If the probe word is the secret word, the player wins. Otherwise, the computer responds to the probe word with two integers: the number of stars and the number of planets. Stars and planets are pairings between a letter in the probe word and the same letter in the secret word. A star is a pairing of a letter in the probe word and the same letter in the secret word in the same position. A planet is a pairing between a letter in the probe word and the same letter in the secret word, but not in the same position as in the probe word, provided that neither of the two letters are involved in a star or another planet. The player's score for each round is the number of probe words needed to get the correct word (counting the probe word that matched the secret word)
